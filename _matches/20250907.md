          - txt: Charge for parking at Martham has been included in the entry fees; Tony has agreed a direct payment to Martham Boats for anglers required to park there. This arrangement is for the use of the adjacent field and removes the need for anglers to use the Pay & Display machine. A parking permit for display will be included in the envelope when drawing a peg at Martham.
          - txt: Please email **[tony.gibbons@ndaa.org.uk](mailto:tony.gibbons@ndaa.org.uk)** to book or for further information.
          - txt: Please bring boots/waders and platform as some pegs in the ronds will be underwater.
